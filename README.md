# discord-bot

When developing, run server locally with `BOT_TOKEN=<bot_token> node bot.js`. This will actually connect it to the server, so it will affect your "production".

Deployed instance of server is running on Heroku. Whatever you push to `production` branch automatically gets re-deployed to Heroku.
